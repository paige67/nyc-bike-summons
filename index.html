			Several years ago, Naftali Ehrenkranz was pedaling to beat a yellow light on DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn when a police car pulled alongside him. He didn’t think he’d broken any laws or run a red light, but he was handed a ticket anyway. He forgot to pay the civil summons–which triggered a chain reaction across state lines, resulting in his Massachusetts driver’s license being suspended. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That kind of minor infraction once came with a civil fine–but as of April 2025, it could now lead to a criminal case. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Since late <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/02/policy-change-nypd-will-write-criminal-summonses-not-traffic-tickets-for-cyclists">April</a>, the NYPD has escalated enforcement against cyclists, shifting from civil fines to criminal summonses. Aimed at curbing e-bike chaos, the policy is sweeping low-income delivery workers–many immigrants–into the criminal system. 
		</p>


		<section class="content-block">
			<h2>'Out of Control'</h2>
			<p>
				Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who is leading the charge, said that the new policy is meant to target "out of control" e-bikes, but all cyclists, especially cyclists of color, are now at an increased risk of entering the criminal justice system for a wrong turn or a careless moment. (Commissioner Jessica Tisch and the NYPD did respond to a request for comment.)
			</p>

			<p>
				While the NYPD stated that they are responding to complaints from neighborhood residents about reckless biking, Daniel Flanzig, a lawyer who is representing some of the first individuals headed to court following Tisch’s new policy, criticized the panic around delivery drivers. “It’s ironic–-it's the same people that complain about their food being late from DoorDash that complain about the e-bikes.” 
			</p>

			<p>
				The new NYPD policy has alarmed New York City’s biking community but this isn’t the first time that NYPD has given out criminal court summonses to cyclists, in fact, they issue over a thousand each year. But cyclists rarely saw ‘pink tickets’ for non-arrest offenses like biking on the sidewalk. 
			</p>

			<h2>Biking While Black
</h2>
			<p>
				When Renel, a Black biker who lives in Canarsie heard the news about increased ticketing, he decided he didn’t want to risk harassment from the police and put his bike away for the summer. “It's just created a hostile environment in my perspective, and it's also changed the way that I've seen policing as well,” said Renel. “It's hard for me to imagine that the policy won't be enforced in that discriminatory manner.”
			</p>

			<p>
				A criminal record can jeopardize employment, housing, and especially immigration status. An analysis of criminal summons for cyclists prior to policy change investigated by the NYCity News Service showed a troubling pattern of enforcement. Last year a Black biker was 6 times more likely to get hit with a criminal summons than a white rider. 
			</p>

<iframe title="In 2024, Black cyclists were more than 6x more likely than white (non-Hispanic) cyclists to get a criminal summons." aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LQjQ1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LQjQ1/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="567" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>

			<p>
			According to <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/15/tisch-rap-nypd-criminal-e-bike-summonses-surge-4000-percent">Streetsblog</a>, the NYPD has issued more than 900 criminal court summonses to cyclists since April 28–double the number issued in the first quarter of 2025 in just a few weeks. 
			</p>


			<p>
				If current enforcement patterns hold, Latino cyclists are bearing a disproportionate share of the crackdown: in the first months of this year, non-Black Latino riders made up nearly one in three summonses, a jump of more than five percentage points above the long-term average. Advocates say many are being targeted not for dangerous behavior, but simply for riding e-bikes while Latino.
			</p>

			<p>
			Further analysis shows that over the eight years that the NYPD has recorded race data in these citations, Black and Black-Hispanic cyclists received nearly half of all tickets while non-Hispanic white people received just seven percent of citations for biking on the sidewalk or commercial bike infractions. Further, white cyclists received fewer citations over eight years than e-bikes did over the past several weeks. 

			</p>

			<p>
			While comprehensive data on the racial demographics of NYC cyclists is lacking, a limited 2022 Citywide Mobility Survey showed that white New Yorkers are 38% more likely to bike compared to New Yorkers of color and more than twice as likely compared to Black New Yorkers.

			<h2>Immigration Concerns</h2>
			<p>
				The NYPD’s mission to target e-bikers through issuing criminal summonses for all cycling infractions may only make this racial disparity in ticketing worse–especially for those who make a living zipping around New York’s streets, a group that is overwhelmingly non-white and Hispanic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Delivery drivers and cycling advocates worry that the NYPD policy’s criminalization of minor infractions dovetails with broader enforcement tactics targeting immigrant communities.
			</p> 

			<p>
				“We already know that the NYPD is cooperating with ICE, even though that’s against city law,” said Robin Graven-Milne, the owner of Bike Plant, a repair shop in Bed-Stuy. “If this policy is really about safety, there are many proven ways to make the streets safer rather than a return to broken windows policing.”
			</p> 

			<p>
				Many fear that these criminal summonses could jeopardize riders’ immigration status, compounding the personal and economic risks they face just by doing their jobs. “This crackdown doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” agreed Ehrenkranz. “It coincides with how the Trump administration has escalated ICE actions and terrorized immigrant communities.” 
			</p> 

			<p>
				Those working closely with these delivery drivers, like Luis Cortes director of Los Deliveristas Unidos (LDU), have seen an uptick in workers receiving criminal summons. Cortes said that over the past weeks LDU members come in hoping to pay fines online per usual, only to discover they must appear in court, putting their livelihoods and immigration status in danger.
			</p> 

			<p>
				Delivery drivers sometimes take risks to meet unrealistic delivery times but Cortes and allies say that the further punishment for traffic violations disproportionately harms vulnerable workers. “They are just trying to make it on time–and if we’re going to criminalize that, then we’re criminalizing poverty,” said Graven-Milne of Bike Plant. 
			</p>

			<p>
				“Delivery app companies are taking the money, but workers bear the weight of being on the streets all day, with no support or benefits,” said Cortes. “This policy adds yet another layer of precarity, forcing workers to choose between safety, survival, and the risk of deportation.” The LDU leader thinks that the app companies should take responsibility or at the very least not deactivate the accounts of workers who receive a pink ticket. 
			</p>

		<p>
				Mayoral candidate and city comptroller Brad Lander agreed when posed the question by the NYCity News Service at a recent forum. “There are tickets for offenses, but there should not be criminal summonses– for violations coming from DoorDash, Seamless, or UberEats, the app companies should be held accountable.”
